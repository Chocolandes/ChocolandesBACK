In this repository you can find the codes that allow you to build the application  that controls and are suposed to be uploaded in the microcontrollers of an electronic device that has the ability to measure mass, dispense a liquid, mix the liquid with a stepper motor and measure the temperature of the liquid, all synchronously and continous.

## Material's list:
### In this project we use two ESP32 microcontrollers. One is dedicated to the stepper motor movement (ESP-MOT) and the other is in charge of all the other functionalities (ESP-MAIN).
### L293D
Dual DC motor driver

* VCC: 5V
* Vss: 12V
* Pin 4 y 5: GND

### HX711
Load cell ADC converter

* E+: Red
* E-: Black

### A4988
Stepper motor driver 
* Dir: D19  ESP-MOT

* D13: Data DS18B20
### ESP-MOT
* D5: Enable A4988
* D19: DIR A4988
* D18: STEP A4988
* D34: Data HC020P

## Repository's codes:
* /include/main1.cpp:
  Code that runs on the ESP-MAIN.  It measures mass, dispenses water, measures temperature, communicates via I2C with the ESP-MOT to move and measure the speed of the stepper motor, and communicates via Wi-Fi with the device's application.


* /include/main2.cpp:
  Code that runs on the ESP-MOT. It communicates via I2C with the ESP-MAIN to receive the instructions that move the  stepper motor.
